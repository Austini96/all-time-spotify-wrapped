# All-Time Spotify Wrapped

A comprehensive data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and visualizes a user's complete Spotify listening history using modern data engineering tools and practices.

## Reference

This project is built upon concepts from [spotify-api](https://github.com/calbergs/spotify-api.git) by calbergs and is developed further into incorporating DuckDB for OLAP database as well as OpenLineage and Marquez for complete column level data lineage. 

## üéØ Objective

Deep dive into a my complete song listening history to analyze top artists, tracks, genres, listening patterns, and audio feature preferences. This project recreates "Spotify Wrapped" that can be viewed at any time of year with richer insights.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Tracking**: Hourly API calls during active hours (0-6, 14-23 UTC)
- ‚úÖ **Historical Analysis**: Integrates 2+ years of extended streaming history (89K+ plays)
- ‚úÖ **Playlist Trend Discovery**: Tracks which playlists contain my favorite songs
- ‚úÖ **Data Lineage**: Complete column-level lineage tracking with OpenLineage + Marquez
- ‚úÖ **Cost Efficient**: 100% open-source tools, hosted locally

### Data Flow

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Extraction**
- **API Extraction** (`extract_spotify_data`):
  - Calls Spotify API for recently played tracks (50 most recent)
  - Fetches audio features, artist details, and playlist information
  - Saves responses as CSV files with timestamp
  - Runs hourly during active hours (0-6, 14-23 UTC)

- **Extended History** (`load_extended_history`):
  - Requested Extended Streaming History data from [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/)
  - One-time load of historical streaming data (2022-2025)
  - Contains 230,000+ plays with rich context (platform, country, shuffle, skip reasons)
  - **Smart Skip**: Checks if data exists and skips reload to save full load time (~40s)

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Loading** 
- **DuckDB Loader** (`load_to_duckdb`):
  - Creates/updates raw tables in DuckDB
  - Tables: `raw_spotify_tracks`, `raw_spotify_audio_features`, `raw_spotify_artists`, `raw_spotify_playlists`, `raw_spotify_playlist_tracks`, `raw_spotify_extended_history`
  - Uses upsert logic to handle duplicates
  - Parallel execution with extended history load

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Transformation (dbt)**
- **Staging Layer**:
  - `stg_spotify_tracks` - Cleans and deduplicates API track data
  - `stg_spotify_extended_history` - Parses extended history with track ID extraction
  - `stg_spotify_audio_features` - Normalizes audio characteristics
  - `stg_spotify_artists` - Artist metadata with SCD Type 1
  - `stg_spotify_playlists` - Playlist information
  - `stg_spotify_playlist_tracks` - Track-playlist relationships

- **Marts Layer**:
  - `dim_tracks` - Track dimension (combines API + extended history)
  - `dim_artists` - Artist dimension with play counts and listening time
  - `dim_albums` - Album dimension with aggregated stats
  - `dim_playlists` - Playlist dimension with track counts
  - `fct_listening_history` - **Core fact table** with:
    - Extended history context (platform, shuffle, skip, country)
    - Audio features joined in
    - Data source tracking (API vs extended history)

- **Analytics Layer**:
  - `top_tracks_daily` - Daily top track rankings
  - `top_artists_daily` - Daily artist popularity
  - `listening_patterns_hourly` - Time-based listening behavior (CST)
  - `audio_features_analysis` - Mood and audio preference trends
  - `playlist_analysis` - Playlist engagement and mood analysis

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Lineage Tracking**
![OpenLineage](Marquez%20Lineage.png)
- **OpenLineage Integration** (`emit_lineage`):
  - Emits column-level lineage for all 16 dbt models
  - Tracks transformations from raw sources through staging to analytics
  - Shows exactly which raw columns feed into each analytical metric

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Sync**
- **PostgreSQL Sync** (`sync_to_postgres`):
  - Copies analytical tables from DuckDB to PostgreSQL
  - Metabase connects to PostgreSQL for visualization
  - Automatically recreates tables to pick up schema changes

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Quality & Documentation**
- **dbt Tests**: Validates data quality (uniqueness, not null, relationships)
- **dbt Docs**: Auto-generated documentation with data lineage graph
- **Slack Alerts**: Automatic notifications on pipeline failures/retries


## üìà Data Schema

### Key Metrics Available

**Listening History Facts:**
- Play timestamps (UTC & CST)
- Track, artist, album details

- ‚úÖ Success after retry

**Setup:**
1. Create a Slack app and incoming webhook
2. Add webhook URL to `.env` as `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
